# WiCS

WiCS, "Workbook information Consolidation System", is a laravel application for centralizing and enforcing validation on workbook/spreadsheet modifications. 

WiCS allows users to specify spreadsheets, along with column headings and validation rules on data entered into those columns. The the user can then assign individuals he/she would like to add information to that spreadsheet, with the application strictly enforcing validation on the information.

WiCS is a lightweight laravel application with an object-relational graph database on the back-end.
